# ML-Marathon-Dataset-by-Azure-Developer-Community
Data : The data is related to direct marketing campaigns of a financial institution.The marketing
campaigns were based on phone calls. Often, more than one contact to the same client was
required, in order to assess if the product (bank term deposit) would be ('yes') or not ('no')
subscribed. You will have to analyze the dataset in order to find ways to look for future
strategies in order to improve future marketing campaigns for the bank.

11 - day: last contact day of the week (categorical: 'mon','tue','wed','thu','fri')

12 - duration: last contact duration, in seconds (numeric). Important note: this attribute highly affects the output target (e.g., if duration=0 then y='no'). Yet, the duration is not known before a call is performed. Also, after the end of the call y is obviously known. Thus, this input should only be included for benchmark purposes and should be discarded if the intention is to have a realistic predictive model.

13 - campaign: number of contacts performed during this campaign and for this client (numeric, includes last contact)

14 - pdays: number of days that passed by after the client was last contacted from a previous campaign (numeric; 999 means client was not previously contacted) 15 - previous: number of contacts performed before this campaign and for this client (numeric)

16 - poutcome: outcome of the previous marketing campaign (categorical: 'failure','nonexistent','success')

Output variable (desired target): 

17 - deposit - has the client subscribed a term deposit? (binary: 'yes','no')
